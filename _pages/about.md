I am a data scientist passionate about helping organizations maximize the value of their data and helping them build a data-driven culture by establishing best practices.

I combine years of research and industrial experience which puts me into a unique position to identify key challenges and address them with a pragmatic yet rigorous approach.

In my past experience, I have helped large scale organizations build data analytics frameworks that resulted in a significant and quantified impact on their bottom line. I possess a fair amount of project management skills that I gained while leading an industrial research project during my PhD at EPFL. I have excellent communication and presentation skills. In the past, I have conducted workshops and presented scientific research at numerous international conferences. 

Besides work, I love spending time with my 10 months old, playing badminton and watching documentaries.
